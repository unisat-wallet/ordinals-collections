  "description": "Sometimes God opens the heavens to view the world below. At this time, stars fall as light from the heavens. So if you make a wish at this time, your hope will reach God's ears and he will grant your wish. But it is only open for a moment. Therefore, you must recite your wish so that it reaches God's ears at the same time the shooting star appears.",
