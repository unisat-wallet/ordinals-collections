  "description": "An algorithmic travel through physical and conceptual dimensions.This digital weaving loom interconnects different dimensions: the physical world limited by space and time, and the unlimited possibilities of numbers, mathematics and the mind.The colorful geometric patterns appearing on the distant background are the result of bitwise XOR, AND, OR operations that are commonly used by hashing functions in cryptographic systems. The resulting colorful patterns also resemble textile weaving patterns due to their properties of symmetry and fractalness.Press keyboard "Space" to capture a screenshot of current view.Code written in JavaScript / WebGL / GLSL.Uses oframe/OGL library and custom algorithms.",
