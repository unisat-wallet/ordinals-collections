  "description": "CursedRecursiveDestiny is the first collection that combines the concepts of \"cursed\" and \"recursive\" inscriptions. It recursively references the content of the \"RecursiveDestiny\" collection. It creates the Chinese traditional chronological calendar known as the \"Stems and Branches chronology\"（干支纪年） or \"Sexagenary cycle.\" The Stems and Branches chronology has been used since ancient times as a method of recording years. By pairing the Stems and Branches in a specific order, a cycle of 60 years is formed, repeating endlessly in a continuous recording.\n\n《CursedRecursiveDestiny》 是第一个融合了诅咒+递归的铭文合集。它递归引用了 《RecursiveDestiny》 合集的内容。组合出了中国传统纪年历法：”干支纪年“。干支纪年自上古以来就一直使用的纪年方法。 干支是天干和地支的总称。 把干支顺序相配，正好六十为一周期，周而复始，循环记录。",
