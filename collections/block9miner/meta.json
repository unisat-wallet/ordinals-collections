  "description": "The Block 9 Collection, made up of 99 Ordinal NFTs, is represented in a unique and original 3D pixel art style. Block 9 was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 9th, 2009, and stands as the oldest block in circulation, unless Satoshi Nakamoto himself reactivates his wallet. Within the blockchain universe, these Block 9 Miners will operate autonomously, constantly unearthing valuable tokens and NFTs for their owners. They also double as playable characters in the upcoming Bitcoin-based blockchain game. Owners of the Block 9 Miner Ordinal NFTs have full intellectual property rights over their Ordinal NFTs.",
