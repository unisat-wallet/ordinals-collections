  "description": "This community-curated collection features seven unique characters, each handcrafted from clay, originally from a different blockchain. After falling through a burn portal, these characters found themselves stripped of their identities and trapped in unwanted alien bodies. Now, XXX of these characters have emerged on satoshis, leaving their holders on a quest to unlock their true human forms. The collection was self-minted and 155 registered under the 200k inscription mark by the artist Brrrbon.An additional missing pod was inscribedc between 200-350k inscriptions and the final settlers (ones in orange backgrounds) are from 600k and above.",
