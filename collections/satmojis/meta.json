  "description": "Satmojis is an open-supply collection of pop art emoticons inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain permanently as an experiment in the anthropomorphizing of sats and web3 graffiti. An extension of Ordinal theory which assigns a face & icon to its sat making it instantly recognizable. Not only are they collectible hand-drawn fine artworks, they also serve as a decentralized CC0 emoticon library that can be used in by anyone permissionlessly via recursive inscriptions. They are the first bitcoin sticker pack & will also be on Discord, Telegram, GIPHY & Tenor. By \n@PxPshrz",
