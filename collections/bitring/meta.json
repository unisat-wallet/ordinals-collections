  "description": "Introducing BITRING – the first animated generative art collection on Bitcoin. Each BITRING is uniquely crafted by a custom algorithm, producing 1 to 5 rings in different colors and sizes, with monochrome being the rarest trait. With only 333 inscribed between the 60k-99k ordinal range, every BITRING holds a distinctive rarity. Burn your ETH BITRING to claim a BTC ordinal on bitring.network – once claimed, your ETH BITRING ceases to exist, transforming into an exclusive Bitcoin artifact inscribed in the early days of ordinals.",
