  "description": "Song(松|宋) is an oriental art piece featuring the imagery of pine trees, symbolizing tenacity and fortitude in traditional Chinese culture. The first generative landscape on BTC. Departing from the artist’s previous works, “Song” adopts a unique style of generative landscapes inspired by the landscape paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties, particularly the flourishing era of literati landscape paintings. In these paintings, solitude and ultimate simplicity are expressed through the partially imaginary landscapes within the artist's mind. Artist: random_combo (Twitter/X): https://x.com/ComboRandom ",
