  "description": "This work explores a monochromatic world of interconnected corridors, halls, structures and possible landscapes, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and transition. Using noise algorithms and shaders to create textures, shaping landscapes that blurs the line between existence and the unknown.The monochromatic palette emphasizes the ambiguous nature of the depicted liminal space, giving structure to the corridors, suggesting a journey through the gray areas of life and death; And textures add a surreal touch, distortions and nostalgia.The play of light and shadow, introduces a subtle distortion that challenges perception. The algo, with weaving patterns, symbolizes the complexity of our experience, inviting observers to navigate through the interplay, contemplating the enigmatic threshold between what is known and what remains undiscovered.
