  "description": "When the Ordinal technology appeared, we realized that this was the most expensive storage system in human history, where anything stored would exist with the history of mankind, possibly forever. What we should store in it? We have formed a collection, named 'Bitcoin Masterpieces', signifying that the content here often comes from the hands of masters and represents the most essential part of human knowledge. This collection: Is entirely decentralized, serves as a bridge between the Web3 world and human society and culture, and its value will continue to increase as more people join Web3; Is the first Bitcoin NFT project based on cutting edge artificial intelligence technology, where we use the BLIP2 model to recognize images and ChatGPT to determine which images should be included; Is a collection of extremely low scarcity and high value, with the probability of such data appearing in the future becoming almost negligible due to the soaring Gas fees and the significant increase in inscription numbers.",
