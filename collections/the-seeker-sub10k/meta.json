  "description": "A collection of early inscribed assets from an indie game in development.\nThis is a self-contained Sub10K collection, but its various elements will expand into their own individual collections as the game develops and new assets are added.\nThis is an attempt at a unique approach to funding game development: the game will be released as Free and Open Source, while funding will be achieved through the sales of collectibles.",
