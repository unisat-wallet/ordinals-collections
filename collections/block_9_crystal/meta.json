  "description": "Block 9 Crystals are a limited and crucial natural resource in 'Block 9 Legend', a Sandbox game based on BTC Ordinals. There are three varieties of Crystals: Genesis (9 units), Rare (90 units), and Common (900 units).Common crystals can be mined in-game, while Genesis and Rare crystals are exclusively available to Block 9 Miner holders during early project activities.These crystals offer several functions: 1. They can evolve standard mining tools into legendary artifacts. 2. When delivering the final hit to a monster/animal, there's a chance of taming it to become your pet 3. Post-battle, crystals will automatically soak up XP, removing the need for manual XP accumulation.4. Having crystals can reduce transaction taxes in in-game shops and auction houses.5. Crystal holders will constantly receive \"ENERGY\" which is pivotal for upgrading gears and facilities.6. Holding crystals will have more airdrops specifically for crystals.",
