  "description": "The Infinites AI, a unique collection of 512 artworks by FAR, was initially minted on Ethereum in 2021, and is now stored on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain. These pieces were born from the union of two generative processes: a StyleGAN, trained on the Great Masters' artworks, and an on-chain method that augmented selected StyleGAN outputs.Each work resulted from this dual process, with previously generated StyleGAN images being enhanced on-chain by custom software, which was written in three.js. This software created unique artifacts at the point of minting on Ethereum.The Infinites AI's relocation to Bitcoin highlights the dynamic evolution of blockchain art, with each artwork's individuality preserved through recursive inscriptions.",
